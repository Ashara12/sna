                    In April 2013 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1ava66/has_anyone_ever_made_a_graph_of_how_all_the/">I posed the question</a>: has anyone ever tried to perform social network analysis on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> by visualising the links between different subreddits? As you can see from the discussion on that page, several other attempts have also been made at answering this question, mainly by using sidebar links to define connections between subreddits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This page is my first attempt at answering this question in a new way. I've produced two graphs showing links between subreddits:
                </p>
                <h2><a href="selfposts.html">Self-post map</a></h2>
                <p>
                    In this interactive map, associations are defined when a redditor posts a link to one subreddit in another subreddit. The data was cropped quite heavily to make the map readable so some of your favourite subs (most notably the big ones) may be missing. Tested in Chrome and Firefox, doesn't work in IE yet I'm afraid.
                </p>
                <h2><a href="xposts.html">Xpost map</a></h2>
                <p>
                    In this interactive map, associations are defined by common links, i.e. if the same website is linked to from two different subreddits, then that's an association. There's much more data here, including the big subreddits. The subs are arranged so that they should appear close together if they  Beware, this dataset is quite big and may require a lot of resources to render!
